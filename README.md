# Analyzing New York City Top Puplic Schools

* In this analysis, I delved into the average total SAT test scores of public schools across New York City, employing Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn to craft a series of visualizations. Our exploration uncovered noteworthy patterns and insights that can serve as valuable guidance for parents navigating the task of selecting the ideal school for their children. I utilized a line plot, heatmap, and bar charts to showcase my findings.

* After a thorough analysis, the data reveals that Staten Island public schools boast the highest average SAT scores, closely followed by Queens and Manhattan, with the Bronx and Brooklyn trailing behind. However, it's essential to consider the context: Staten Island, despite having the highest averages, has the fewest public schools, numbering only 10. This realization adds nuance to the initial impression of impressive scores.

* Comparing Brooklyn and the Bronx, both boroughs, with a relatively similar number of public schools, exhibit comparable average SAT scores. Queens stands out with the second-highest average SAT scores, even though it has the second-lowest number of public schools at 69.

* Remarkably, Manhattan emerges as the top-performing borough overall. With a substantial 89 public schools and an impressive average SAT score of 1340, it appears to be a prime location for those looking for a puplic school to enroll in.

* In summary, while Staten Island's average SAT scores shine, the limited number of schools should be considered. Manhattan, with a combination of a high number of schools and strong average scores, emerges as a promising choice for future enrollees.
