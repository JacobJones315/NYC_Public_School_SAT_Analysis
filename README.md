# Analyzing New York City Top Puplic Schools

* In this analysis, I delved into the average total SAT test scores of public schools across New York City, employing Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn to craft a series of visualizations. Our exploration uncovered noteworthy patterns and insights that can serve as valuable guidance for parents navigating the task of selecting the ideal school for their children. I utilized a line chart, heatmap, and bar charts to showcase my findings.
